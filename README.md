# Secure Privacy Task 2

## Overview
This is a console application that evaluates binary strings to determine if they are "good." A binary string is considered good if it meets the following criteria:

- Equal number of 0's and 1's.
- For every prefix, the number of 1's is not less than the number of 0's.

This repository contains the implementation of the evaluation logic along with unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the functionality.

## Features
- Validates binary strings based on predefined criteria.
- Returns `true` for good binary strings and `false` for bad ones, empty strings, and strings with invalid characters.
- Includes comprehensive unit tests to verify the functionality of the evaluation method.
